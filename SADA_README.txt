Initially, I created a GIT repo with powershell name, since my os name was powershell too
Then I renamed my osname dir from powershell to ansible_scripts
hence I am pushing all the files from here to powershell

git add .
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/sadaiyer/powershell.git
git push -u origin master
